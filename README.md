## 📁Projects

### Project 1: Data Modeling Project 📐

- **Description**: This project involved designing a relational database for a fictional e-commerce platform. The database was designed to manage customer information, orders, and product data.
- **Technologies Used**: SQLite, Python, Pandas
- **Key Features**:
  - Entity-relationship diagrams (ERD) 📊
  - Data normalization to eliminate redundancy ♻️
  - SQL scripts for creating and populating tables 📝

### Project 2: SQL Analysis 🔍

- **Description**: In this project, I performed SQL queries to analyze sales data from a retail database. The focus was on extracting insights related to sales trends and customer behavior.
- **Technologies Used**: SQLite, SQL
- **Key Features**:
  - Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT) ➕
  - Grouping and filtering data 🔎
  - Joins to combine data from multiple tables 🔗

### Project 3: Data Visualization 📈

- **Description**: This project involved visualizing the results from the SQL analysis using Python libraries. I created interactive charts and dashboards to present the findings effectively.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Matplotlib, Plotly, Dash
- **Key Features**:
  - Interactive plots and dashboards 🎨
  - Insights into sales performance by region and product 📊
  - User-friendly interface for data exploration 👥
